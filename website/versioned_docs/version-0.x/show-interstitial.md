Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of their host app. They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game. When an app shows an interstitial ad, the user has the choice to either tap on the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app.

## Usage

```js
document.addEventListener('deviceready', () => {
  admob.interstitial.load({
    id: {
      // replace with your ad unit IDs
      android: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/yyy',
      ios: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/zzz',
    },
  }).then(() => admob.interstitial.show())
}, false)
```

## Methods

### `admob.interstitial.load(config)`

Load interstitial ad.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves when ad request is loaded, rejects when ad request failed.

See [`config`](./ad-request-options.md#reference).

### `admob.interstitial.show()`
