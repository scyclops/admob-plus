The device volume, controlled through volume buttons or OS-level volume slider, determines the volume for device audio output. However, apps can independently adjust volume levels relative to the device volume to tailor the audio experience.

## Set App Volume

Valid ad volume values range from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (current device volume).

By default, the app volume is set to 1 (the current device volume).

```js
admob.setAppVolume(0.5)
```

## Mute App Volume

```js
admob.setAppMuted(true)
```
